# Simple To‑Do List

A simple to-do list app where users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## Frontend

The React frontend lives in:

- `frontend_react_js/`

Quickstart:

```bash
cd frontend_react_js
npm install
npm start
```

### Backend (optional)

Configure `REACT_APP_API_BASE` (or `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`) in `frontend_react_js/.env` to enable REST persistence.  
If not configured or the backend is unreachable, the UI will still work using localStorage.
